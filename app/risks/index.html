              <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Anyone, including children, can develop heart disease. It occurs when a substance called plaque builds up in your arteries. When this happens, your arteries can narrow over time, reducing blood flow to the heart. Smoking, eating an unhealthy diet, and not getting enough exercise all increase your risk for having heart disease.
              </p>
              <h2>Risk factors</h2>
              <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Several risk factors play an important role in determining whether or not you’re likely to develop heart disease. Two of these factors, age and heredity, are out of your control.<br><br>

           <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center"><br><br>
           The risk of CHD increases around the age of 55 in women and 45 in men. Your risk may be greater if you have close family members who have a history of heart disease.<br><br>

He feared not being able to do things he’d always done, like playing tennis.)
